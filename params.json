  "body": "AnimmexAPI\r\n==========\r\n\r\nAnimmex is a not-so-popular website hosted in Russia that provides a platforrm\r\nto update and watch videos of all kinds. However, it is ad-riddled and you are\r\nforced to use it through the browser. I am making this API simply as an\r\nexperiment and to increase the platforms on which the site can be used.\r\n\r\nThe API has been built in VS as a portable class library that is compatible with\r\napplications on iOS, Android and Windows, and with Xamarin. The actual supported\r\nenvironments are as follows:\r\n\r\n* .NET Framework 4.5\r\n* ASP.NET Core 5.0\r\n* Windows 8\r\n* Windows Phone 8.1\r\n* Xamarin.Android\r\n* Xamarin.iOS\r\n* Xamarin.iOS (Classic)\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nAll of the functions and classes have XML documentation supported by Xamarin,\r\nalthough a wiki with more information will be available in the future.\r\n\r\nExample Usage\r\n=============\r\n\r\nAs of the most recent build, there is a whole 1 function available for usage!\r\nHereâ€™s an example. You might want to look at the structure of AnimmexVideo\r\nobject to see what you can do.\r\n\r\n    var api = new AnimmexClient();\r\n    var videos = api.GetRecentlyViewed();\r\n    foreach (AnimmexVideo video in videos) {\r\n        MessageBox.Show(video.Title);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis project is simply as an experiment for myself, expect this code not to\r\nnecessarily be held to production standards or the like. I will however mark\r\nthis under the MIT License so it is available to be used freely.\r\n",
