AnimmexAPI
==========

Animmex is a not-so-popular website hosted in Russia that provides a platforrm
to update and watch videos of all kinds. However, it is ad-riddled and you are
forced to use it through the browser. I am making this API simply as an
experiment and to increase the platforms on which the site can be used.

The API has been built in VS as a portable class library that is compatible with
applications on iOS, Android and Windows, and with Xamarin.
